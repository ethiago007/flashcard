            <div class="javascript">JavaScript is a programming language used to make web pages interactive. JavaScript
                is a scripting or programming language that allows you to implement complex features on web pages —
                every time a web page does more than just sit there and display static information for you to look at —
                displaying timely content updates, interactive maps, animated 2D/3D graphics, scrolling video jukeboxes,
                etc. — you can bet that JavaScript is probably involved. </div>

                An operator is a special character (or characters) that indicates an action to be performed. An operator
                is capable of manipulating a certain value or operand. Operators are used to perform specific
                mathematical and logical computations on operands. In other words, we can say that an operator operates
                the operands. In JavaScript operators are used for compare values, perform arithmetic operations etc.

            <div class="variables">Variables are one of the major features of computer programming and we will use them
                all the time. A variable is just a container that stores some information such as a number, an object,
                or a string. In programming, a variable is a value that can change, depending on conditions or on
                information passed to the program. Typically, a program consists of instruction s that tell the computer
                what to do and data that the program uses when it is running.

                " _ ". The convention, however, is to always begin your variable names with a letter, not " $ " or " _

                        function in JavaScript is similar to a procedure—a set of statements that performs a task or
                        calculates a value, but for a procedure to qualify as a function, it should take some input and
                        return an output where there is some obvious relationship between the input and the output.

                        are actions that can be performed on objects. A JavaScript method is a property containing a
